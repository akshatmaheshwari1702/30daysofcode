        <p>We use CSS to add style to our HTML documents.</p>
        <p>There are a few different ways to add CSS to a document,
             but for time being we'll be using <em>inline</em> CSS.</p>
        <h2>Inline CSS</h2>
        <p>Inline CSS is written directly in our HTML using a style attribute.</p>
        <p>We can style any element using inline styles, from the body to headings and paragraphs, 
            <a href="#">as well as links</a> and strong and em tags too!</p>
